                p.question Question: How much water should I bring on a hike?
                p.answer Answer: The recommended intake of water while exercising is one-8 ounce cup for every 15 minutes of vigorous activity. If it is an easy hike, you could consider reducing intake in half, but always be prepared with more water than you think you will need just to be safe. We also recommend having spare water in your car for when you return from the hike. Be safe!

                p.question Question: Where are the best hikes in the country?
                p.answer Answer: A wonderful thing about hiking in general is that each hike is it's own adventure. One of the best parts of travel is seeing new environments and being surprised by new terrain. With that said, the best hikes really depend on what you are looking for in a hike. The biggest factor that we like to take into consideration is the type of terrain in the area. For example, if you hate walking in sand, we do not recommend certain places in the western parts of the country. New section on best rated hikes in the country coming soon!
